## DapperLink - Custom URL Shortener Chrome Extension

DapperLink is a Google Chrome extension I developed to streamline web navigation by providing the functionality to create and manage personal URL shortcuts. With this tool, users can assign a short alias for a frequently visited website, and thereafter easily navigate to that site by simply typing `go/shortname` into the address bar.

This project entailed designing a user-friendly interface where users could add, view, and manage their custom URL shortcuts. The core of the extension was built around the Google Chrome's `webRequest` API, which I used to intercept browser requests and redirect them based on the custom URL mappings defined by the user.

DapperLink is all about boosting productivity and streamlining the browsing experience. It provides a simple yet powerful solution to the often-tedious task of typing long URLs, demonstrating my commitment to developing tools that enhance user experience, improve daily workflows, and save valuable time.

**Technologies Used**: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Google Chrome Extension APIs.

**Status**: In Progress.
